# An Open Letter to Celtic Pagans
Many folks know I've been a clergy postulant with ADF for a while and an
 official member since 2003. I've led groves in Austin and Houston, and helped
 contribute to others elsewhere, published blogs, both druidic and on general
 mysticism. I've waged many a pagan argument and usually stand my ground with
 the best of them, though I've made many more missteps to get there.

In 2015 I had a series(seven) of mystical experiences trying to recreate the
 vedic prophecy-potion Soma. "We drank soma, we became immortal, we came to the
 light, we found gods."[^first] It has taken me nearly seven years to get all of
 me back into this world. And so I've been stolen away to fairy and initiated
 into a preisthood by a Fairy Queen who put me through an agonizing tribunal
 where I had a vision of her pulling out my bowels and putting them back in
 after cleaning them. Later I've found bits of what happened to me stowed away
 in folklore. For instance, A man named ‘An’ is visited by a 'nightmare' figure
 who stabs him in the stomach and pulls out his entrails. He lies dead having a
 second dream or vision that she is putting his entrails back in[^second].
 
Having had this same vision as a man who lived more than twice seven centuries
 ago, I count it as one of my lived experiences that is seared into memory.

Needless to say, I feel qualified and confident in writing this letter.

## The Problem

I have studied Neodruidism, the Celtic Reconstructionist Methodology and its
 subsequent religions, druidcraft(drycraeft), medieval witchcraft and folk
 magic, and more. I found my only home with [ADF](http://www.adf.org) for a while but
 I feel differently about that now. ADF prepared me to an extent, but it was the work and
 time of members of the reconstructionist movement which help shaped me.

I keep going back to Animism as a missing foundation of Polytheism as is
 apparent in the studies of Nurit Bird-David, Durkheim, Guthrie, and Strathern.
 There existed an animistic polytheism which still demonstrates itself in the
 expressions of scholars in medieval tradition and colloquial expression.

I also keep trying to escape the prevalent attitude among people that druid
 ritual and practice has nothing to do with folk magic even though one of its
 names is dreecraft after draoi or druid. So in some circles you've got plenty
 of people calling themselves druids who don't like druidry(magic). If they're
 not into draiocht, then why is it in their name? Magic and witchcraft have been
 continually seen as being unrelated to the topic of druidry. At a corporate
 meeting a former member of a druid group expressed he didn't like the
 interpretation of draíocht as magic, even though that is the best translation
 of the word.

I've invested in this idea of a high liturgy within polytheist practice as
 potentially recognizable by my ancestors. The ancestors who worshipped our gods
 went straight into the days of the stowe missal's liturgy toward a high
 liturgy. We'll never know for certain, but one can easily suspect from the
 other pagan elements that underwent christianization, that these new liturgies
 were just reused performances that are within the spectrum of human expression.
 We can order items in this spectrum in a way that feels like our ancestors
 would have recognized them and as a matter of belief in 'tribal totem as mind',
 there is a part of our gods in us that can guide us if we recognize and listen
 to them. I want a liturgy that recognizes the particular nature of the soul,
 particular being literal here for 'having parts'.
 
Often though, druidry and druid groups execute their rites in the most bland and
 not very Celtic way. I long for hearth rites and hill rites that recognize what
 is going on in folklore.

## The Solution

Jane E. Harrison, a Greek Scholar, says **myth is what is '_said_' while ritual
 is what is '_done_'**, and [Cat Heath](https://seohelrune.com/) posts
 descriptions of heathen spell-workings to her facebook account all which
 involve doing a charm act while saying or referencing parts of a folk-tale from
 which the magician has drawn an analogy directly to the outcome. In this model,
 good spell outcomes are likened to the objects won in myth, like Indra
 capturing Soma from the Ashuras, or releasing the rains after slaying Vtra. On
 either side of that is the act of you re-enacting the myth and reciting the
 myth.

So this sense of a ritual order, the core of some groups' identities, that involves
 actions and invocations, and poetry and sometimes music, that opens, offers,
 blesses, and closes just doesn't work for me the way I've been doing it
 anymore. I need something closer to what the Mari in Russia have, what the
 Indian Nayakan have, and what the ancestors who worshiped our gods probably
 had. I can feel what that is, though it isn't drawn out of the waters yet.

I need a set of offices of rites which conceive of the full spectrum of animism
 and polytheist scholarship, some of which consists of a dismemberment of
 primordial sacrifice and the magico-alchemical preparation of that into a
 blessing mostly in metered charm and sometimes unmetered charms, that pair with
 myth as the Christian rites do. When the bread is broken and one half is
 submerged into the chalice in the Celtic Rite, it is a mimicking action of the
 crucifixion, and then the two halves are put back together it is a mimicking of
 the resurrection. That is specifically a different thing than what existing
 neodruid groups present as required to represent their identities. The
 Christians are doing pagan better than than neopagans.

## More of the Problem

Episcopagan is a term I use for pagans with no ritual ecstasis, and I have never
 done ritual outside a state of induced ecstasy. I'm very tired of
 Episcopaganism. I want my paganism to be a song on a spear. Episcopagans are
 avoidant of what excites them because they've spent little time in such states
 and do not know how to inhibit themselves toward social climates while in them.
 Episcopaganism falls along lines of privilege and pressure.
 
People in the communities I'm involved with have no interest in ritual
 reformation, the science of group ecstasy, no interest in dropping questionable
 things like the "Norse Wheel of the Year". I feel like they completely miss the
 mark on some things. I have no faith in a single family of Indo-European paganisms
 anymore. Any time I've tried to build it, the Heathens screw it up. Modern
 Heathens have trouble maintaining honorable relationships. So instead of a
 family of articulated culture-specific hearths, groups like ADF are either
 culture-specific adverse pan-IE mush or Celts-with-friends. Celts-With-Friends
 means ADF is 90% Celtic with some non-celtic IE groups that get involved.

Celts-with-friends doesn't need a pan-IE motive or model, like what ADF has. You
 can focus all your druid energy on the Celts alone and still achieve this
 without trying.

Groups like ADF seem to be slower than an oak in reconstructing the best view of
 what Paleopagans speaking a Celtic or Indo-European Language actually did. In
 1983 The Org set out to publish a journal on par with academic journals worth a
 value of $279 per year in today's money. This isn't what you get with Oak
 Leaves.

## More of the Solution

What can we do? We fix it by creating an alternative.
 
Thanks to the research of the Rees Brothers, the people who produce Duchas.ie,
James MacKillop, John T. Koch, John Carey, Barry Cunliffe, Patricia Monaghan,
Danaher and Dáithí Ó hÓgáin, all the true folklorists of the Celtic Revivalist
Period and Indo-European comparative scholars, we can just go about giving it a
good old try at knowing what was done and why it was done.

We'll take the recently uncovered principles of animism, comparative polytheism,
tri-functional theory, and produce a well thought out worldview and practice.

### Purpose

The purpose of this letter is to announce the creation of this Project as a
 Culture, Religion and as a new group of people who practice it. The creation of
 this clan is in the spiritual vein of the old Déis or Déisi of the 4th century.

Originally an artificial clanless designation for vassals and farmers, déisi
 groups with artificially made lore of a lineage from kings eventually became a
 few real clans with real political power. Due to their close interactions,
 common expulsions, or belief in a lore-ideology, déisi groups became several
 real tribes, including one from which the clan I belong claims to descend. The
 Ó Dea's and Godwin's I've practiced with claim descendancy from the Good God,
 the Dagdae and that is the god who we will view as our first ancestor(dies
 pater).
 
The Déisi also moved into Wales and Britain between 300 and 450 C.E making three
 things apparent to us:
 
 1. They were the original Celtic diasporans but in the 4th century.
 1. Time forges fake clans into real ones.
 1. People of any kind of Celtic descent across the entire Celtic spectrum of languages can
    claim to be descended from a tribe that exists only as an idea.

Greece was divided into artificial tribes that by close proximity became
 real as communities when they switched to a Democratic government, making them
 something we can reconstruct.

Clan Ó Déa claims to be a sept of Dál gCais(Dalcassians) who claims to be
 founded by the King of Thomond(Co Clare) named Cormac(Tál) Cas, son of Conall
 of the Swift Steeds. Yet, modern scholarship says that is the fakelore Déisi
 Muman of Munster used to solidify their right to power. Regardless, the Dál
 gCais are claimed as ancestors by a great number of lineages:

O'Curry, O'Cormacan, O'Seasnain, O'Brennan, Glinn, Magan, Muldowney, O'Hurley,
 MacNamara, Harley, Stoney, Hickey, O'Hay, Clancy, Flattery, O'Grady, Tubridy,
 Hartigan, Durkin, Killeen, Hogg, O'Dea, O'Quin, MacBrody, O'Heffernan, Kielty,
 Perkin, O'Meara, Scanlan, MacArthur, Cosgrave, O'Hogan, Lonergan, O'Brien,
 MacMahon, MacConsidine, MacLysaght, O'Crotty, Eustace, O'Kennedy, O'Reagan,
 O'Kelleher, Boland, O'Casey, Power, Twomey, Ahearne, Magrath, Plenty More.

You do not have to be part of one of these clans to join us. Membership within
 our clan is not dependent on coming from a Celtic background, only that your
 existence ahead of you is Celtic in that you'll practice the culture in this
 project with us becoming a people by doing so. We believe that
 stay-in-your-own-lane religions always lead to the increase in racism. What we
 do is for everyone who loves it, even an Englishman who wants to reform himself
 into one of us. Your love for it is born of our Béan Sí and somehow it left
 her, traveled the world and entered you, making you our kin. After all, satan
 comes through the TV.

### Name

In Irish and Scottish we'll be known as the Ó Déisi, Mac Déisi or the Déiseanna,
 in Welsh we'll be called the Ap Deiliad, In Gaulsih language we can be refered
 to as the Dala. Déis is cognate with Proto-Brythonic *dalg-, from
 Proto-Indo-European *delgʰ-. Cognate with Latin indulgeo. Proto-Brythonic
 *dalg- from Proto-Indo-European *delgʰ- means to split, divide, cut, carve and
 the English word tiller descends from it making our clan predominantly a
 working class peoples. It's fitting that the words we'll use to define
 ourselves are made of the stuff of defining. We will certainly carve out our
 own place in the cosmos.

We will practice the same core familial religion in every Celtic language that
 we have septs in. It will not be considered a pan-Celtic religion but a
 core-Celtic religion with wide-sweeping variations among cultural subgroups,
 and more localized variations in every house-hold.

### Ancestors

Using the term Déisi invokes the third century groups as well as the twelfth
 century ones as our ancestors. We can claim descendancy from *Dyeus who tills
 with this weapon, we see that god in Sucellos, Taranis, and as Dago Deiwos(the
 Dagda). He is our first ancestor, our Béan Sí is the local land goddess in
 Clare named Anand/Anu in Cailleach form resides in Cahercalla(fort of the Hag).
 The Déisi are expected to pilgrimage to this fort near Magh Adhair at least
 once in their lives. You can do a [Virtual Pilgrimage](https://voicesfromthedawn.com/magh-adhair/) now.
 
Additionally we also have a foster Béan Sí who is the land goddess upon which we
 now dwell.

I've already started this project and have begun an open-source project called
 the Public Celtic Encyclopedia as well as a license which can apply to any
 cultural works we produce for intra-clan use. I will not be able to complete it
 alone and I can only script it to copy wikipedia articles and make a list of
 those to rewrite. This is better than nothing I feel for a start though this is
 not the long term strategy which is to purposefully research and write every
 single topic.

We aim to include everything in the encyclopedia: history, polytheology, liturgy,
 legal structures, art and music, calendars and customs. We'll organize it in
 ways that will be intuitive for folks looking for everything related to this
 and this time or for such and such event.

This is where I need you. I need to help build a fulfilling, accurate, culturally
 responsible, whole cloth, and complete system. So I'm going to need
 contributors and feedback from those who plan to invest in membership when the
 time is read.

Now Celtic Paganism is not for everyone, so an initial large response is not
 expected, required, or desired. However, we will welcome whatever response we
 get as we've asked for everyone who wants to join to consider it.

If you're interested, 

Please consider filling out the interest form here and we'll figure out a way to
keep you apprised of this Ó Déisi druid's progress.

With a little bit of luck, the blessings of the Gods and a great deal of hard
 work, we can create an artificial clan who practices a religion our ancestors
 would be proud of and recognize.

Béal o na nDeithe ort... Blessings of the Gods on you!
