# What is OpenSource Religion? Why is it Good or Needed

## What is Open Source?
'Open source', 'Opensource', and 'Free and Open Source Software'(FOSS) are terms
for an idea that sets of computer instructions are better off free to be used
and improved by the community. Free secondarily means free as in free beer.
Primarily it means it is without restriction or it comes with as few
restrictions as possible. As it turns out, FOSS tends to be better because more
eyes are on it. It's less vulnerable to third parties injecting malicious
instructions into the set because of this, those vulnerabilities can be fixed
and re-released instantly because the community isn't concerned with product
launches, go-lives or developed at a more rapid pace than private software.

## What does this have to do with Celtic Paganism?
Culture isn't different from software in that sets of instructions are analogous
with sets of behavior. Instruction is a bat term for a line of code because the
processor is compelled by physics to perform the instruction.

Treating culture like software, with vulnerabilities and features, with tools
and tasks, as a process which yields behavior and experience as outputs, we can
see that it suffers from the same problems software does, albeit in analogy.
Culture can benefit from openness, tracking, freedom, and licensing exactly like
software can.

## Can be widely used
If something can be widely used by more minds, it will have more thinking power
and thus innovation behind it. Whatever the project, open sourcing anything
makes it better.

## Responsive
The community produces the product in an opensource project. Issues are filed
and discussed, changes are proposed and made; this continuous iteration over
feedback and production makes the project's growth a response to how the
community uses it. Other Druid & Pagan orders are prescriptive rather than
responsive.

## Financial Advantages
You don't need to pay for a membership for training. You could write a fiction
book based on this lore or these texts and not need to pay us. You could start a
paid membership based druid order forking this project as a basis of some public
gnosis while putting initiate gnosis behind a paywall. This work gives your
freedom over it while also granting you freedom to make money from it.

## Future-proof
As a responsive, space aged, git project, you can take this code anywhere. It
can live on a chip, a disk, a processor. You could send the entirety of Public
Celtic Mythos here into orbit, reading out its contents in morse code. I'm
excited to see what people might do with Free and Open Source Religion(FOSR) as
fun anthropological experiments.

## Transparency
You will never get to the end of a progression in this religion and find out
that we _really_ believe in a figure like Xenu, or 

## Availability
You'll never not have access to the github project.

## Unmanaged
If a change is good, and a certain number of approvers agree on it, the software
uses devops and git ops to deploy itself. The code merges itself and really this
is all done by clicking buttons in a sequence per a process after reading
proposed changes. The hardest part is discussing your change's precedence.

## Scale
This text and these practices can work for small groups and large groups after
some modification and you have the freedom to call it the same thing, despite
these modifications.

## Speed
Changes don't take long to make. Not Ent length meetings or waiting for a
festival or group meeting to make changes. If it looks good on paper and is well
explained, we can grow this order speedier than an oak, like magicians ought.

## Secure
Insecure egoic priests who thirst for attention and use Celtic Paganism to
satiate that desire, won't do well here when folks are on equal footing as
contributors and we use a certain statistical number of approvers. These kinds
of priests operate partly in the dark. FOSR's transparent and democratic nature
secures it against well or bad intentioned trouble-makers and secures it from
harmful practices entering the body of praxes here.

An open-access culture which doesn't operate in the dark can avoid systemic
abuses traditionally expected to be found in churches, orthodox, evangelical or
mormon societies.
