# Bottom Up or Top Down Approach. Which is Better?

This is a layout to explore which method is best to determine the proper order
of the creation of the guides section of this project.

## Bottom Up
* Lay programs first, bard second, seer third, druid fifth
* PCE throughout

### Cons
* Take forever to get prieists to help you build the project.
* 
### Pros
* Get attention of laity by providing regular resources.

## Top Down
* Druid first, seer second, bard thrid, lay programs last.
* PCE throughout

### Cons
* Take forever to get the attention of lay ppl, regular practitioners
 
### Pros
* Attract priests to help you build the project faster as you go.

## Stradle Approach

* Lay programs first, Druid programs 2nd, other programs afterward.

## Cons
* Potential to have an unfinished product of laity and priests, but no witchy,
  mantic or bardic programs if the project runs out of steam before attracting
  contributors.

## Pros
* Attract laity at the right time.
* Build a priesthood which can help you build the remaining parts sooner.

# Conclusion
I think the last option, a staggered approach has the least amount of risk, the
most amount of benefit.
