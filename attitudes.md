# Noble Attitudes Toward Celtic Paganism
## Anti-racist
Non-racist isn't enough. Our order will never go fight battles on racism because
that is not our projects goal. But one of our attitudes we take toward our goal
is rooting out racism and racist attitudes within our own spaces.
## Anti-facist
## Celtophilia / Celtophobia
## Anti-credulity
## Regarding people speaking Celtic languages
## pro soft-Sapir-Whorfism
## pro diaspora
## non-credulous
## spiritual hucksterism
   1. https://www.culturalsurvival.org/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/spiritual-hucksterismthe-rise-plastic-medicine-men
## plastic shamanism
   1. Hucksters never take responsiblity for how what they sell is recieved.
   1. Imitation & Romanticism
   1. Holy people have revelations of insightful information.
   1. Hucksters are obsessed with symbols and the arrangement of them over their
      meaning.
## pan-practices
## there are areas where you don't belong
## you can do the rites but they aren't empowered unless you have the teachings
## religion changes on large time scales, core tenets of IE paganism are 1000s of years old, not days
## taking what's sacred and making it profane
## selling classes is hucksterism
## proselytizing is the mark of a charlatan, genuinely spiritual people don't do it.
## advertizing to people interested in this stuff isn't proselytizing
## American Indians ask us to go back to our own ways instead of adopting theirs
## New aged stuff makes people feel good, but healing happens where it hurts

### Acculturation

The process of acculturating to these praxes and rites, ways of being and
operating, is strictly and primarily done through the reading and following of
these texts, and mentorship by someone ordained a priest of these texts. These
texts are the arbiter of this religion and culture. This project and these
texts, I feel are divinely inspired by my work with the Cailleach, who, I think
inspires different approaches within different people who work with her.

This may not go anywhere, nor might it become popular... if it simply serves as
a basis for a small group of followers of this cult-worship, it has well served
a purpose. These texts belong to those who immerse and steep themselves within
them. If you love these texts, you cannot be denied a belonging to it. The texts
should be guided by the average opinion of those belonging to it. "Average
opinion" here simply means the calculated middle of all extremes divided by the
number of extremes. The wisdom of the crowd provides error correction that the
visionaries cannot see, just as the visionaries in a group provide a path
forward that the crowd cannot yet see.

The means of acculturation is immersion in this lore and its people. This lore
provides almost nothing for those interested in autocratic pride in separation
from the tribe. Solo practitioners among us are just our people disconnected
from one of our locus of culture. Anti-social or people-hostile solo
practitioners have less of a belonging in these texts.

   people that are looking for something that is real. - Dennis

### Appropriation
A group of people taking a heritage they have access and rights to, tracking it
with perfect diligence, defining the praxes and precedents of it, and making it
available for acculturation, takes a bite out of appropriation. It doesn't just
pay it lip-service by a technical and legal loophole, open-sourcing a culture,
like open-sourcing software, eliminates the number of imitators because they can
just get the real detailed information.

In our modern world, especially in North America, we are in a culture which
produces people who are longing and yearning for connection to something deeply
rooted. If you don't give them good information, they will imitate what they see
and fill in the holes.

It's bigger than simply the idea that indigenous people have nicer ceremonies
and we want them too. Often I see reconstructions looking like American-Indian
lookalikes, replacing warpaint with runes and headdresses with leather dangles.
A great number of American-Indians perform ceremony in suits or jeans because
materialism is a western ideal. The clothes making the man is not a tenant of
cultures which are dwelling in the same place as the homeland of their language.

Therefore, acculturation to something new and complex involves changing
fundamental ideas at the root of your worldview. We cannot control, nor do we
wish to control, what other people do with this repository. What we can do is
place restrictions on closing these texts, make sure the texts contain valuable
and accurate information, and promote a certain set of attitudes that when held
creates a sacred and respectable Celtic Paganism within most people.

### Pick and Choose
Compile your religion from the menu of what's available here. A university
offers all majors though a student specializes in one or more. Eventually the
goal will be there there'll be so much here you would run yourself ragged trying
to upkeep them all. This allows each person and house hold to have a set of
unique practices that they've compiled from the source. `Include` whatever part
of these practices you need to accomplish the goals along the lines of the
[attitudes](attitudes.md) expressed in this project.

People who take these texts, pick and choose them, toward goals that do not fall
along the attitudes expressed in this project, though they are licensed to do
so, will be considered poor imitators. The difference between serious cosplay vs
kids Wallmart costumes, or a Ferarri vs a child's bicycle, represents the the
vast difference between recon and post-recon Druids vs 'Celtic Shamans'.

### Emulation instead of Imitation
While emulation is defined by imitation, it is much more than poor imitation.

Emulation is an form of imitation that takes seriously all of a system or
processes inputs and outputs and tries to arrange them correctly until it
functions in an identical way to the original form.

Playstation consoles, for instance, operate on code that people cannot see.
However, people create their own code to handle the inputs and outputs so that
the game will run, sometimes poorly. Poorly emulated games just need more time
to develop. A key point of emulation is that you know how something is supposed
to function though you cannot see the processes which make it do so.

There is currently no form of Celtic paganism that isn't emulated or imitated
since the original is long gone and since the contents of the original is up to
speculation. However, Academic pursuits equip us with a lot of tools to
illuminate the likely options, which we can, like emulators, try and see if the
experiences described by people in the Vedas are what one experiences when they
try to recreate Soma, for example.

People emulating Celtic Paganism sometimes claim to be more authentic than
others, but such claims are basically made for internet keywords because that
what people expect and search for. Additionally authority vocalization and
language is the number one factor people use to judge authority. So its enticing
to cast a circle of validity and lord over it. But this can't be done by people
with a serious and intelligent mind who place authenticity with intellectual
honesty.

The fact that there are no practicer of original Celtic paganism, it puts
everyone on the same footing as an emulator.
